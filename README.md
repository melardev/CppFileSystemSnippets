# Introduction
This repository contains Cpp snippets related to the filesystem.<br>
They are intended to be cross platform since they rely on the standard library,<br>
or if perhaps they differ depending on the platform I took care of using the appropriate<br>
`#if defined`, please let me know if a demo
does not work on your platform.

This repository corresponds to a bigger CMake project I have, I didn't published it yet, because I have to refactor it.
Be patient for the bigger cake :)
